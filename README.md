Purpose
-------

The website was created for the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development course Stream 1 project. The framework is based on code developed during the course lessons.

The site is a static (front-end only) website for an actual band. The intended audience is fans of the band and anyone wanting to find out more information about it and experience its music. Users of the site can view the latest band news, tour dates and venues, band member information and music videos. There are links to the band’s Youtube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages and also providers of official music, merchandise and concert tickets.

Users can also register to the site to enter competitions and receive discounts on the site’s merchandise. Due to the front-end only nature of the site, information entered into the registration form is only validated, not recorded, tour information is retrieved from a .json file and sale of goods is via links to other websites.

Testing and deployment
----------------------

Functionality of the website has been tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox at screen sizes down to 320px. The final code has been deployed on Heroku.

Technologies used
-----------------

Angularjs for the framework and navigation
Bootstrap for a responsive layout, together with flexbox and media queries
